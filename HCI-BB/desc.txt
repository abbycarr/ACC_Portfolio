Although no longer a deployed site, this project was a full testing of our ability to iteratively design while conducting major user research, user testing, and user-focused design. Neighbors have had a harder time communicating with each other during the pandemic. Communities that were already close-knit found it hard to social distance and maintain their connections while neighbors who were not already connected felt more isolated than ever. Although we cannot create that connection ourselves, we want to allow more fluid communication between members of a community in the hopes that we can help them help each other during the post-pandemic world. During the pandemic, people started to lose touch. So, we wanted to create easier communication with the people that are physically close during the post-pandemic world. We wanted to emphasize creating a stronger community.
