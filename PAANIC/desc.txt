resented at RISE Northeastern. Robotic advancements call for the further application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the ability of robots to understand natural language instructions from humans. As such, we have developed a method to reduce mistakes in robotic following of human commands by implementing hazard tagging on natural language instructions, which can then be modified into the real-life application of robotic grip strength, general procedure for a task, and navigation of dangerous situations.
