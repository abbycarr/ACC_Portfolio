Modeling Disease Spread
11/2020 - 12/2020

Desc
As a group, we decided to focus on the modeling of disease.The main model we looked at was the SIR model; this model was important as it was one of the basic and core models in epidemiology. The SIR model provided our group with a more specialized scope for our broader interest in modeling disease. Our groupâ€™s goals were to find some insight into how models were affected by different factors of disease. After work looking into research papers, explanations on the math of the SIR model, and discussing together, the project transformed from work on understanding the SIR model to trying to model COVID-19 ourselves with a version of the SIR model.
