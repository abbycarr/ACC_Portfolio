Designing an Imaginary World: CHROMA
05/2022 - 06/2022

Desc
Through the course Designing Imaginary Worlds flourished a group project to create a comprehensive creative world. See our mantra below, and explore our World Bible and Theme park. Taking the time to create an extendable and fleshed-out world requires not only creative energy, but also the ability to develop culture, geography, and language that defines the people in the world we make. Our values as a group led us to create a world on a high level that does not rely on the exploitation of the peoples or resources of the world. We do not wish to devoid our world of conflict or divisions at all, but rather hope to have communities that rely on the innate power and magic they have and to have exploration without timelines that focus on war. In addition, our world wishes to step away from the normative structures of gender and gender roles and explores a world where the size of bodies is much larger than that portrayed by many cultures in the world today. Please take our world and immerse yourself into it with kindness in mind.
