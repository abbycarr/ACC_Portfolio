Infectious Disease Simulator
10/2020 - 10/2020

Desc
Built during a 48-hour Hackathon Built in Visual Studio Code and Replit using Python, HTML, and CSS. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were inspired to create a simulator that would serve to educate people about how disease spreads rapidly through a population and what measures can be taken to slow the spread. For us and for many other folks, the near catastrophic effects of the pandemic on our way of life was jarring to say the least. As a group, our team believes that, in the future, the key to an effective response is education on widespread preventative measures. To this effect, we created a website and accompanying simulator focused solely on educating others on how disease is spread and what factors play a part in its propagation. Our simulator uses graph theory to organize and manipulate a randomized matrix in order to model a random population of a type determined by the user. By iterating through the matrix and using chances of infection, exposure, and mortality, we are able to create a model of the spread of a disease through a given population using python code and principles of linear algebra.
