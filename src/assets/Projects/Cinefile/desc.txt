Cinefile is an application to locally store films that a user has watched. The project was developed to meet requirements for the final project of CS3200 - Database Design. Running on a MySQL database and a React front-end, Cinefile allows users to learn more about the films in the database, give ratings for films they have watched, and analyze data about their viewing and rating habits.
